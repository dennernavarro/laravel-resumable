## Using Resumable.js with Laravel

How to Use?

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `composer install`
3. Run `php artisan serve`
4. Create a directory called *temp* under *public* directory and give it write permissions. On a Linux you would be doing `mkdir public/temp` and then `sudo chmod -R 777 public/temp`

Have fun!
